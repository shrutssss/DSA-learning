//department can be granted membership on request. Similarly one may cancel the membership of a club. First node
//is reserved for the president of the club and the last node is reserved for the secretary of the club. Write C++
//program to maintain club memberâ€˜s information using singly linked lists. Store student PRN and Name. Write
//functions to: a) Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary. b) Compute total number of
//members of club c) Display members d) Two linked lists exist for two divisions. Concatenate two lists
